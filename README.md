# AppleToSpotify
This program acts as a converter which takes music from Apple Music and adds it to Spotify. This is useful for users looking to switch from one platform to another wanting to take their music with them.
##
# Instructions
This application works by taking a URL of any public Apple Music playlist through an API Call and getting the titles, artists, and albums of all songs in the playlist.



Once all data is obtained, a seperate API Call will search/filter the songs by title, artists, and/or albums and add them to the user's Spotify account.
